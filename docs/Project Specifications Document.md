# Najm Academy Platform Specifications Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Najm Academy Platform, an online educational system designed to support in-person and free-access learning. The platform enables course management, student progress tracking, evaluations, certificate issuance, and role-based dashboards. It complies with data protection laws (e.g., loi 09-08 for consent and retention) and prioritizes simplicity, security, and usability.

### 1.2 Scope

- **In Scope**: User authentication, course creation and management, manual enrollments, quizzes/exams, progress tracking, certificate generation with QR verification, role-specific dashboards, basic notifications, and compliance features.
- **Out of Scope**: Payment integrations, private appointments, videoconferencing, advanced analytics (e.g., AI-driven insights), mobile apps, forums/social features, and third-party integrations (e.g., external calendars).
- **Assumptions**: Free access for all users (manual enrollment by admins); supports up to 500 concurrent users; developed as an MVP for beta testing with 5-10 users.
- **Constraints**: 12-week timeline; team of 2 developers plus product manager; tech stack limited to Next.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS, and supporting tools.

## 2. User Roles and Personas

The platform supports four roles with role-based access control (RBAC):

- **Student**: End-user learner. Accesses assigned courses, takes quizzes, views progress, downloads certificates.
  - Persona: 18-25 year-old in-person student; needs simple, mobile-friendly interface for tracking progress.
- **Trainer**: Content creator and evaluator. Creates and manages courses, grades quizzes, provides feedback.
  - Persona: Educator with basic tech skills; requires tools for uploading materials and monitoring students.
- **Sub-Admin**: Local school manager. Handles manual enrollments, tracks absences and notes, views local dashboards.
  - Persona: Administrative staff; focuses on in-person group management.
- **Admin**: System overseer. Manages users and roles, validates courses, oversees global dashboards, handles compliance (data export and deletion).
  - Persona: IT-savvy manager; needs audit logs and export tools.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.3 Course Catalogue and Management

- **FR-CM1**: Students browse/search courses (filter by title).
- **FR-CM2**: Trainers create/update/delete courses with chapters (videos/PDF uploads, limited to 10MB).
- **FR-CM3**: Admins validate courses before publishing.
- **FR-CM4**: Free access: Students view content only if enrolled.

### 3.4 Enrollments and Learning

- **FR-EL1**: Manual enrollment by Admin/Sub-Admin (assign users to courses).
- **FR-EL2**: Students access chapters, take quizzes/exams (MCQ auto-grading, open-ended manual).
- **FR-EL3**: Real-time progress tracking (% completion, updated via React Query).
- **FR-EL4**: Trainers provide feedback/comments; Sub-Admins log absences/notes for in-person students.

### 3.5 Certificates and Verification

- **FR-CV1**: Auto-generate certificates (PDF with QR code) on 100% progress + minimum score.
- **FR-CV2**: Public verification page (/verify?hash=...) to validate certificates via QR scan.
- **FR-CV3**: Admins/Trainers can recommend/issue certificates manually.

### 3.6 Dashboards and Reporting

- **FR-DR1**: Admin Dashboard: Global KPIs (active students, completion rates) with Recharts (line/bar charts); CSV exports (PapaParse).
- **FR-DR2**: Sub-Admin Dashboard: Local stats (enrollments, average notes, absences); filter by school/group.
- **FR-DR3**: Trainer Dashboard: Per-course stats (views, quiz results, drop-offs).
- **FR-DR4**: Student Dashboard: Personal progress, results, certificates; basic in-app/email notifications (e.g., completion alerts via Nodemailer).

### 3.7 API Layer

- **FR-API1**: RESTful endpoints (/api/users, /api/courses) with CRUD operations (Drizzle ORM).
- **FR-API2**: Validation with Zod; RBAC guards on all protected routes.
- **FR-API3**: Error handling with standardized responses (e.g., 403 for unauthorized).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

- Page load times < 3 seconds (caching with React Query/Redis if added).
- Support 500 concurrent users (Vercel scaling).
- Database queries optimized with indexes (Drizzle).

### 4.2 Security

- HTTPS/TLS enforcement.
- Password hashing (bcrypt); sensitive data encryption.
- RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) middleware; audit logs for all actions.
- Compliance with loi 09-08: User consent logs, data export/deletion APIs, retention policies (e.g., delete after 24 months).

### 4.3 Reliability and Maintainability

- 99% uptime target; basic monitoring (Sentry for errors).
- Code coverage: 70% unit/E2E tests (Vitest/Playwright).

- **Enrollments**: id, user_id (fk), course_id (fk), progress (float 0-100), notes (jsonb for absences/grades), feedback (text).
- **Quizzes**: id, course_id (fk), questions (jsonb array), type (enum: 'auto', 'manual').
- **Certificates**: id, enrollment_id (fk), issue_date, hash (uuid for QR), pdf_url.
- **Logs**: id, user_id, action (text), timestamp.

### 5.2 Relationships
