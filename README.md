## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: User accounts with roles (ADMIN, SUB_ADMIN, TRAINER, STUDENT)
- **domains**: Course categories/subjects
- **courses**: Course content with teacher assignments
- **modules**: Logical grouping of related chapters within a course _(NEW)_
- **chapters**: Course chapters now associated with modules (not directly with courses)
- **enrollments**: Student course enrollments
- **chapter_progress**: Student progress tracking

### Modular Course Structure

The platform uses a three-level hierarchy for organizing course content:

```
Course
  â””â”€ Module (e.g., "HTML Fundamentals")
      â”œâ”€ Chapter 1: "Introduction to HTML"
      â”œâ”€ Chapter 2: "HTML Document Structure"
      â””â”€ Chapter 3: "Semantic HTML"
```

**Benefits**:
- **Better Organization**: Group related chapters into logical modules
- **Improved Navigation**: Students can see course structure at a glance
- **Progress Tracking**: View completion percentage per module
- **Flexible Structure**: Easily reorder modules and chapters

**Implementation Notes**:
- Modules reference courses via `courseId`
- Chapters reference modules via `moduleId` (changed from `courseId`)
- Cascade deletes ensure referential integrity
- Module management is ADMIN-only (TRAINER role cannot manage course content)

### Assessment Tables
- **content_items**: Flexible content system (video, text, quiz, test, exam)
- **content_item_attempts**: Student attempts on quizzes/tests/exams
- **final_projects**: Course final project requirements
- **project_submissions**: Student project submissions and grades

## Scripts

```bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Start dev server
bun run build            # Build for production
bun run start            # Start production server
bun run lint             # Run ESLint

# Database
bun run db:push          # Push schema to database
bun run db:seed          # Seed test data

# Testing
bun run drizzle/test-auth-flow.ts  # Run auth tests
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers via `/register` with email, password, name, and role
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storage
3. User logs in via `/login` with credentials
4. NextAuth creates a JWT session with user data and role
5. Middleware checks authentication and role for protected routes
6. User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
7. Logout destroys session and redirects to login

## Testing

Run the comprehensive authentication test suite:

```bash
bun run drizzle/test-auth-flow.ts
```

This tests:
- User registration and password hashing
- Login with valid/invalid credentials
- Role-based redirects
- Protected route access
- Authorization per role
- Session structure

See `drizzle/README-AUTH-TESTS.md` for details.

## Auth and RBAC Pattern

This project enforces authentication and role-based access primarily via NextAuth middleware for protected route prefixes:

- /admin â†’ ADMIN
- /sous-admin â†’ SUB_ADMIN
- /formateur â†’ TRAINER
- /etudiant â†’ STUDENT

Guidelines:

- Use middleware for access control so unauthorized requests are rejected early, improving perceived navigation speed.
- In layouts/pages inside protected segments, avoid calling requireAuth unless the routeâ€™s access rules differ from the prefix-level rule. Prefer getCurrentUser when you only need the current userâ€™s info for UI (header, etc.).
- Keep requireAuth for special cases where a route allows multiple roles (e.g., ADMIN and TRAINER) or has additional ownership checks. Middleware can be extended later with more granular matchers if needed.

Rationale:

Placing requireAuth in both the segment layout and page triggers multiple getServerSession calls per navigation, which can slightly slow down transitions. Relying on middleware for gating and calling getCurrentUser only where the user object is needed reduces redundant work while keeping behavior intact.
