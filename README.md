- Progress tracking and completion certificates
- Final project submissions and reviews
- Responsive design with dark theme

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Runtime**: Bun (recommended) or Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.0+ or Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, or local)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-learning-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

4. Push database schema:
```bash
bun run db:push
```

5. Seed the database with test data:
```bash
bun run db:seed
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
bun run dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Test Accounts

After seeding, use these credentials to test different roles:

| Email                | Password    | Role      |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| admin@example.com    | password123 | ADMIN     |
| subadmin@example.com | password123 | SUB_ADMIN |
| teacher@example.com  | password123 | TRAINER   |
| student@example.com  | password123 | STUDENT   |

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: User accounts with roles (ADMIN, SUB_ADMIN, TRAINER, STUDENT)
- **domains**: Course categories/subjects
- **courses**: Course content with teacher assignments
- **chapters**: Course chapters with content (video, text, quiz)
- **enrollments**: Student course enrollments
- **chapter_progress**: Student progress tracking

### Assessment Tables
- **quizzes**: Quiz definitions with questions
- **quiz_attempts**: Student quiz submissions and scores
- **final_projects**: Course final project requirements
- **project_submissions**: Student project submissions and grades

## Scripts

```bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Start dev server
bun run build            # Build for production
bun run start            # Start production server
bun run lint             # Run ESLint

# Database
bun run db:push          # Push schema to database
bun run db:seed          # Seed test data

# Testing
bun run drizzle/test-auth-flow.ts  # Run auth tests
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers via `/register` with email, password, name, and role
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storage
3. User logs in via `/login` with credentials
4. NextAuth creates a JWT session with user data and role
5. Middleware checks authentication and role for protected routes
6. User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
7. Logout destroys session and redirects to login

## Testing

Run the comprehensive authentication test suite:

```bash
bun run drizzle/test-auth-flow.ts
```

This tests:
- User registration and password hashing
- Login with valid/invalid credentials
- Role-based redirects
- Protected route access
- Authorization per role
- Session structure

See `drizzle/README-AUTH-TESTS.md` for details.
